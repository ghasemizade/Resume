I have an important strength that if you ask any of my friends I think it's the first thing they mention. When I look for something, I get it.


I learn quickly and I love learning.

As a weakness, I can point out that I will never give up. Sometimes I lose a lot of time because of this. Just tell me one thing, that you can not do something and then you have to see what happens. Of course, I'm working on it.
